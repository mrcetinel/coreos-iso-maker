#####  RHCOS - OCP 4.2 Installation #####
------------------------------------------
# coreos-iso-maker
Create a bunch of coreos ISOs for OCP 4.2 installs when you need to set static IPs

This project is borderline close to a gist but should be enough to get you started.

# Problem definition
Some customers would like to use static IPs for their OCP nodes but don't have a
working DHCP server for various reasons.  This can be done using the ISO for CoreOS
and messing with the boot parameters.  However, this is involves lots of error prone
typing.  This project is designed to work around that and create individualized ISOs
for each node.

# Variables to define
In the `group_vars/all.yml` file, define the following variables:

`gateway`  	- default router IP

`netmask`  	- default netmask

`interface` 	- NIC device name.  Defaults to `ens192` which is default for VMWare

`dns`		- dns server

`webserver_url` - webserver that holds the Ignition file

`webserver_port` - webserver port for the webserver above


`ocp_version` 	- OCP version you are going for.  Currently defaults to 4.2

`iso_checksum`	- sha256 checksum of the ISO.  Currently correct as of 2019-10-23 and OCP 4.2

`iso_name`	- Name of the ISO to download.  Makes certain assumptions that should be verified

`rhcos_bios`	- Name of the BIOS image to boot from.  Make certain assumptions that should be verified

In `inventory.yml` you will need to define your hosts:

`bootstrap`	- bootstrap node and its `ipv4` address

`masters`	- You will need to define `3` master nodes and their `ipv4` address

`workers`	- However many worker nodes you want and their corresponding `ipv4` addresses

You will need to use create individual ignition files and load them to your webserver.
This project does NOT currently do that.
